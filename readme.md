## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YASHWANTH3004/DSA_Practice.git
cd DSA_Practice

---

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment
On macOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

---

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
If the requirements.txt is empty or not yet created, you can add packages as needed and freeze later with,
pip freeze > requirements.txt.

---

### 4️⃣ Run a Python File
python3 filename.py
Replace filename.py with the file you want to run (e.g., Basics/arrays.py).
